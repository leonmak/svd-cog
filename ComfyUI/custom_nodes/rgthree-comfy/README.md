# rgthree's Comfy Nodes

A collection of nodes I've created while messing around with Stable Diffusion. I made them for myself to make my workflow easier and cleaner. You're welcome to try them out, but do so at your own risk. Since I made them for myself, I didn't battle test them much outside of my specific use cases.

# Install

1. Install the great [ComfyUi](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).
2. Clone this repo into `custom_modules`:
    ```
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy.git
    ```
3. Start up ComfyUI.

## üêõ Graph Linking Issues

If your workflows sometimes have missing connections, or even errors on load, start up ComfyUI and go to http://127.0.0.1:8188/extensions/rgthree-comfy/html/links.html which will allow you to drop in an image or workflow json file and check for and fix any bad links.

# The Nodes

## Seed
> An intuitive seed control node for ComfyUI that works very much like Automatic1111's seed control.
> <details>
>    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <i>See More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Set the seed value to "-1" to use a random seed every time
>    - Set any other number in there to use as a static/fixed seed
>    - Quick actions to randomize, or (re-)use the last queued seed.
>    - Images metadata will store the seed value _(so dragging an image in, will have the seed field already fixed to its seed)_.
>    - _Secret Features_: You can manually set the seed value to "-2" or "-3" to increment or decrement the last seed value. If there was not last seed value, it will randomly use on first.

## Reroute
> Keep your workflow neat with this much improved Reroute node with, like, actual rerouting with multiple directions and sizes.
> <details>
>    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <i>More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Use the right-click context menu to change the width, height and connection layout
>    - Also toggle resizability (min size is 40x43 if resizing though), and title/type display.

## Context / Context Big
> Pass along in general flow properties, and merge in new data. Similar to some other node suites "pipes" but easier merging, is more easily interoperable with standard nodes by both combining and exploding all in a single node.
> <details>
>    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <i>More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Context and Context Big are backwards compatible with each other. That is, an input connected to a Context Big will be passed through the CONTEXT outputs through normal Context nodes and available as an output on either (or, Context Big if the output is only on that node, like "steps").
>    - Pro Tip: When dragging a Context output over a nother node, hold down "ctrl" and release to automatically connect the other Context outputs to the hovered node.
>    - Pro Tip: You can change between Context and Context Big nodes from the menu.

## Display Any
> Displays most any piece of text data from the backend _after execution_.


## Lora Loader Stack
> A simplified Lora Loader stack. Much like other suites, but more interoperable with standard inputs/outputs.


## Power Prompt
> Power up your prompt and get drop downs for adding your embeddings, loras, and even have saved prompt snippets.
> <details>
>    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <i>More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - At the core, you can use Power Prompt almost as a String Primitive node with additional features of dropdowns for choosing your embeddings, and even loras, with no further processing. This will output just the raw `TEXT` to another node for any lora processing, CLIP Encoding, etc.
>    - Connect a `CLIP` to the input to encode the text, with both the `CLIP` and `CONDITIONING` output right from the node.
>    - Connect a `MODEL` to the input to parse and load any `<lora:...>` tags in the text automatically, without
>      needing a separate Lora Loaders
>    </details>


## Power Prompt - Simple
> Same as Power Prompt above, but without LORA support; made for a slightly cleaner negative prompt _(since negative prompts do not support loras)_.


## SDXL Power Prompt - Positive
> The SDXL sibling to the Power Prompt above. It contains the text_g and text_l as separate text inputs, as well a couple more input slots necessary to ensure proper clipe encoding. Combine with

## SDXL Power Prompt - Simple
> Like the non-SDXL `Power Prompt - Simple` node, this one is essentially the same as the SDXL Power Prompt but without lora support for either non-lora positive prompts or SDXL negative prompts _(since negative prompts do not support loras)_.

## SDXL Config
> Just some configuration fields for SDXL prompting. Honestly, could be used for non SDXL too.

## Context Switch / Context Switch Big
> A powerful node to branch your workflow. Works by choosing the first Context input that is not null/empty.
> <details>
>    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <i>More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Pass in several context nodes and the Context Switch will automatically choose the first non-null context to continue onward with.

## Fast Muter
> A powerful 'control panel' node to quickly toggle connected node allowing it to quickly be muted or enabled
> <details>
>    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <i>More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - Add a collection of all connected nodes allowing a single-spot as a "dashboard" to quickly enable and disable nodes. Two distinct nodes; one for "Muting" connected nodes, and one for "Bypassing" connected nodes.

## Fast Bypasser
> Same as Fast Muter but sets the connected nodes to "Bypass"

## Fast Actions Button
> Oh boy, this node allows you to semi-automate connected nodes and/ror ConfyUI.

>    - Connect nodes and, at the least, mute, bypass or enable them when the button is pressed.
>    - Certain nodes expose additional actions. For instance, the `Seed` node you can set `Randomize Each Time` or `Use Last Queued Seed` when the button is pressed.

## Mute / Bypass Repeater
> A powerful node that will dispatch its Mute/Bypass/Active mode to all connected input nodes or, if in a group w/o any connected inputs, will dispatch its Mute/Bypass/Active mode to all nodes in that group.
> <details>
>    <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <i>More Information</i></summary>
>
>    - üí° Pro Tip #1: Connect this node's output to a **Fast Muter** or **Fast Bypasser** to have a single toggle there that can mute/bypass/enable many nodes with one click.
>
>    - üí° Pro Tip #2: Connect a **Mute / Bypass Relay** node to this node's inputs to have the relay automatically dispatch a mute/bypass/enable change to the repeater.

# Advanced Techniques

## First, a word on muting

A lot of the power of these nodes comes from *Muting*. Muting is the basis of correctly implementing multiple paths for a workflow utlizing the Context Switch node.

While other extensions may provide switches, they often get it wrong causing your workflow to do more work than is needed. While other switches may have a selector to choose which input to pass along, they don't stop the execution of the other inputs, which will result in wasted work. Instead, Context Switch works by choosing the first non-empty context to pass along and correctly Muting is one way to make a previous node empty, and causes no extra work to be done when set up correctly.

### To understand muting, is to understand the graph flow

Muting, and therefore using Switches, can often confuse people at first because it _feels_ like muting a node, or using a switch, should be able to stop or direct the _forward_ flow of the graph. However, this is not the case and, in fact, the graph actually starts working backwards.

If you have a workflow that has a path like `... > Context > KSampler > VAE Decode > Save Image` it may initially _feel_ like you should be able to mute that first Context node and the graph would stop there when moving forward and skip the rest of that workflow.

But you'll quickly find that will cause an error, becase the graph doesn't actually move forward. When a workflow is processed, it _first moves backwards_ starting at each "Output Node" (Preview Image, Save Image, even "Display String" etc.) and then walking backwards to all possible paths to get there.

So, with that `... > Context > KSampler > VAE Decode > Save Image` example from above, we actually want to mute the `Save Image` node to stop this path. Once we do, since the output node is gone, none of these nodes will be run.

Let's take a look at an example.

### A powerful combination: Using Context, Context Switch, & Fast Muter

![Context Node](./docs/rgthree_advanced.png)

1. Using the **Context Switch** (aqua colored in screenshot) feed context inputs in order of preference. In the workflow above, the `Upscale Out` context is first so, if that one is enabled, it will be chosen for the output. If not, the second input slot which comes from the context rerouted from above (before the Upscaler booth) will be chosen.

    - Notice the `Upscale Preview` is _after_ the `Upscale Out` context node, using the image from it instead of the image from the upscale `VAE Decoder`. This is on purpose so, when we disable the `Upscale Out` context, none of the Upscaler nodes will run, saving precious GPU cycles. If we had the preview hooked up directly to the `VAE Decoder` the upscaler would always run to generate the preview, even if we had the `Upscale Out` context node disabled.

2. We can now disable the `Upscale Out` context node by _muting_ it. Highlighting it and pressing `ctrl + m` will work. By doing so, it's output will be None, and it will not pass anthing onto the further nodes. In the diagram you can see the `Upscale Preview` is red, but that's OK; there are no actual errors to stop execution.

3. Now, let's hook it up to the `Fast Muter` node. `The Fast Muter` node works as dashboard by adding quick toggles for any connected node (ignoring reroutes). In the diagram, we have both the `Upscaler Out` context node, and the `Save File` context node hooked up. So, we can quickly enable and disable those.

    - The workflow seen here would be a common one where we can generate a handful of base previews cheaply with a random seed, and then choose one to upscale and save to disk.

4. Lastly, and optionally, you can see the `Node Collector`. Use it to clean up noodles if you want and connect it to the muter. You can connect anything to it, but doing so may break your workflow's execution.
